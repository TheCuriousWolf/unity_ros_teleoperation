Displays `nav_msgs/Path` messages, where a series of Stamped Poses are visualized along with a line connecting them. The line is colored based on a gradient from Green to Red, with the arrows at poses being colored accordingly. Both the size of the arrows and the thickness of the line can be adjusted as needed.
