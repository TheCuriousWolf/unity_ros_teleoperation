# Pose Streaming

This component allows for visualization of Stamped Poses.

## Poses

Unstamped poses are not supported, but all stamped poses are displayed using the appropriate TF frame from the header. For series of stamped poses, consider checking out the `nav_msgs/Path` ([component here](/Assets/Components/PathStreaming/)).
